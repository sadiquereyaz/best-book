1. Maybe using WorkManager for background downloading to handle large files without blocking the UI.
2. If the file is saved in the app's private directory (internal storage), other apps, including the file manager, can't access it unless the device is rooted. 
So using Context.getFilesDir() or Context.getCacheDir() would be better here. Also, using MODE_PRIVATE when writing the file.
3. **PDF Viewer Integration**: Need a library to display PDFs within the app. Options include AndroidPdfViewer, PdfRenderer, or even a WebView if the PDF is rendered online. 
But since the PDF is stored locally, a local viewer would be better.
4.  To add an extra layer of security, encrypt the PDF before saving it. Then decrypt it when loading to display. Libraries like Jetpack Security (EncryptedFile) could be useful here. 
Alternatively, use AES encryption with a key stored in the Android Keystore.
5. **Caching**: If the PDF is only needed temporarily, storing it in the cache might be better, but cache can be cleared. If it needs to persist, use internal storage.
6. **Handling Keys Securely**: If encryption is used, the encryption key must be stored securely. Android Keystore is the best practice for storing keys, as it's hardware-backed and more secure.
7. Save the file with a non-descriptive name and maybe in a non-obvious directory to make it harder to find even if someone has root access.
8. **Network Security**: Ensure the PDF is downloaded over HTTPS to prevent MITM attacks. Also, verify the server's certificate.
9. **libraries**. For PDF viewing, AndroidPdfViewer is a popular choice. For encryption, Jetpack Security's EncryptedFile handles encryption transparently. 
For network, use OkHttp with proper TLS settings.
10. Another consideration: If the PDF is very sensitive, maybe don't store it at all and just stream it from the server each time. 
But the user wants to store it locally, so that's not an option.
11.  file permissions: When writing the file, ensure it's set to MODE_PRIVATE so other apps can't access it.
12. Use a PDF viewer library that can display the PDF from a byte stream or file descriptor.
13. -Use EncryptedFile.Builder to create an encrypted file in the files directory.
    - Write the downloaded bytes to the encrypted file.
    - To display, read from the encrypted file into a temporary file or stream, then load into the PDF viewer.
14. but some PDF viewers need a file path or URI. If the file is encrypted, you can't directly give the path. So you might need to decrypt it into a temporary file that's deleted after use, or use a content provider to serve the decrypted bytes.
Alternatively, use a PDF viewer that can take an InputStream, decrypt the file into a byte array, and pass it as a stream. AndroidPdfViewer's fromStream() method might work.
    - AndroidPdfViewer's fromStream() method might work. So the process would be:
    - Download PDF bytes.
    - Encrypt and save using EncryptedFile.
    - When needed, decrypt using EncryptedFile to get the bytes.
    - Load the bytes into a ByteArrayInputStream and pass to the PDF viewer.
      But handling large PDFs in memory might cause OOM errors. So maybe use streaming decryption and feed the stream to the PDF viewer incrementally.
16. Alternatively, decrypt to a temporary file in the app's cache, which is not accessible to other apps, and then load that file into the PDF viewer. 
The temporary file can be deleted after the viewer is closed.
In that case:
    - Decrypt the encrypted file into a temporary file in the app's cache directory.
    - Use that temporary file's path for the PDF viewer.
    - Delete the temporary file once the PDF viewer is done.
This way, the decrypted file exists only temporarily and in a private directory.
Security considerations here:
- The temporary file, even though in the cache, is still in the app's private directory, so other apps can't access it unless the device is rooted.
- Using EncryptedFile ensures that even if the device is rooted, the stored PDF is encrypted.
- The temporary decrypted file is deleted as soon as possible.
Another point: Use biometric authentication before decrypting and displaying the PDF, adding an extra layer of security. But the user didn't mention this, so it's optional.

# So putting it all together:
- Download the PDF from the server using HTTPS.
- Encrypt the PDF using Jetpack Security's EncryptedFile and store it in the app's internal storage.
- When the user wants to view the PDF, decrypt it into a temporary file in the app's cache directory.
- Load the temporary file into the PDF viewer.
- Delete the temporary file after viewing or when the app is closed.
Potential libraries needed:
- Jetpack Security for encryption.
- OkHttp for downloading.
- AndroidPdfViewer or another PDF library that can load from a file or stream.

* Use DisposableEffect to delete the temp file when the composable leaves the composition.
