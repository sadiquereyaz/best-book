DTO: data transfer object

Lets suppose there is BookDto (Data Transfer Object),
which represents the book data received from a remote API (Retrofit).
The BookDto will later be mapped to the domain model BookModel for use in the app.

@SerializedName: Maps the JSON fields from the API response to the respective properties in BookDto.
